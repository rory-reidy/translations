我要用简体字因为我还没学会了孔子写的字。
### `子曰学而时习之不亦说乎`
Confucius said: One who studies and seasonally keeps in practice, is he not joyous? \
*Maybe change to "studying and practicing seasonally" to better parallel the next line?*
### `有朋自远方来不亦乐乎`
For friends to come from afar, is this not joyous?

One who does not understand, so is content, is he not a *junzi*?

Regarding those who do not like to violate their superiors but like to sow chaos; they do not exist.
### `君子务本本立而道生`
The *junzi* attends to the root. Once the root is established, the *dao* is born.

Confucius said: In clever speech and a pleasing face, *ren* will be rare indeed.
### `曾子曰吾日三省吾身`
Zengzi asked: I reflect three times daily:
### `为人谋而不忠乎与朋友交而不信乎传不习乎`[^4]
Have I been halfhearted in my dealings? Have I been untrustworthy to my friends? Haven't I neglected your teaching?
### `子曰道千乘之国敬事而信节用而爱人使民以时`
Confucius said：To guide a kingdom of 1,000 chariots, one must be trustworthy and respectful of public affairs. One must regulate expenditure and care for man, using timeliness to direct the people.
### `弟子入则孝出则弟谨而信汎爱众而亲仁`
In the home a young man should be filial, and on the outside respectful of his elders. He should be modest and trustworthy. He should float with love for the multitudes of people, and hold benevolence close to his heart.

If opportunities come his way he should use them to culture himself.

### `子曰君子不重则不威学则不固`
Confucius said: If a gentleman is not serious, he will not be revered, and his learning will not consolidate.
