# 学而 - Xue Er
我要用简体字因为我还没学会了孔子写的字。
### `子曰学而时习之不亦说乎`
Confucius said: One who studies and seasonally keeps in practice, is he not joyous? \
*Maybe change to "studying and practicing seasonally" to better parallel the next line?*
### `有朋自远方来不亦乐乎`
For friends to come from afar, is this not joyous?
### `人不知而不愠不亦君子乎`
One who does not understand, so is content, is he not a *junzi*?
### `有子曰其为人也孝弟而好犯上者，鮮矣`[^1]
Confucius also said: Those who are filial and loving, but violate their superiors, are few indeed.
### `不好犯上而好作乱者未之有也`[^2]
Regarding those who do not like to violate their superiors but like to sow chaos; they do not exist.
### `君子务本本立而道生`
The *junzi* attends to the root. Once the root is established, the *dao* is born.
### `孝弟也者其为仁之本与`[^3]
Filial piety, its orientation towards the root of *ren* is probably this.
### `子曰巧言令色鮮矣仁`
Confucius said: In clever speech and a pleasing face, *ren* will be rare indeed.
### `曾子曰吾日三省吾身`
Zengzi asked: I reflect three times daily.
### `为人谋而不忠乎与朋友交而不信乎传不习乎`
Have I been halfhearted in my dealings? Have I been untrustworthy to my friends? Haven't I neglected your teaching?
### `子曰道千乘之国敬事而信`

## Footnotes
[^1]: Here 也 is a pause \
[^2]: 未之有也 means 未有之, but since 未 is negative, 有 comes after the object. 也 gives a tone of resolution. \
[^3]: 也者 Focuses attention on the subject of the sentence while anticipating an explanation. Much like "as for" or "regarding".
