# 《論語》學而 - Xue Er
### `子曰學而時習之不亦說乎`
Confucius said: One who studies and seasonally keeps in practice, is he not joyous?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
子 refers to 孔子, or Confucius.

時 means "time", but really has more to do with seasons and natural cycles.

說 is read as yue4, same as 悅, and 乎 connotes a rhetorical question.
</details>

### `有朋自遠方來不亦樂乎`
For learned friends to come from afar, is this not joyous?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
There are some strange associations between 朋 and 友 and other words.

In ancient times
朋 meant 門, or door/gate/opening.
友 meant 志, or purpose/will.
門 was associated with 一師門 and 學.

Another source associates it with disciples, 弟子.

So I add "learned" to "friends".
</details>

### `人不知而不慍不亦君子乎`
One who is ignored by other people, yet is not angered, is he not a *junzi*?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
慍 is a verb meaning anger. Pronounced yun4.
</details>

### `有子曰其為人也孝弟而好犯上者鮮矣`
Youzi said: Those who are filial and loving, but violate their superiors, are few indeed.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
有子，名若。我姓銳，所以我大概是銳子。

者 takes the verb/action clause that comes before it and turns it into a noun.

為人 means behavior towards others or personal character.
</details>

### `不好犯上而好作乱者未之有也`
Those who respect their superiors, but like to sow chaos, are nonexistent.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
未之有也 means 未有之, but since 未 is negative, the object 之 is put before the verb 有. 也 gives a tone of resolution.
</details>

### `君子务本本立而道生`
The *junzi* attends to the root. Once the root is established, the way is born.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
Here 道, dao4, is the same 道 from the DaoDeJing. Not to necessarily promote an equation of these two ideas, but there is definitely some similarity.
</details>

### `孝弟也者其為仁之本與`
Filial piety: it is probably the root of benevolence.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
The modal expression 也者 Focuses attention on the subject of the sentence while anticipating an explanation. Much like "as for" or "regarding".

與 is a questioning particle, like 吧. It is related to the modal particle 欽, which gives a tone of respect. The structure 其....與 was often used to give an affirmative statement a softer speculative tone.
</details>

### `子曰巧言令色鮮矣仁`
Confucius said: In a man with clever speech and a pleasing face, benevolence will be rare indeed!
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
鮮矣仁 has been transposed from 仁鮮矣 to accentuate the statement.
</details>

### `曾子曰吾日三省吾身`
Zengzi said: I reflect three times daily.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
三, meaning three, is used to mean three times 三次
</details>

### `為人謀而不忠乎與朋友交而不信乎傳不習乎`
Have I been halfhearted in my dealings? Have I been untrustworthy to my friends? Have I neglected your teaching?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
These are the three reflections Zengzi asks himself daily.

謀而不忠 is "to plan for or to counsel and not be completely committed to".

傳 means "to teach" or "what was taught" [by Confucius]. Interpreting it as the latter.
</details>

### `子曰道千乘之国敬事而信節用而愛人使民以时`
To guide a kingdom of 1,000 chariots, one must be conscientious of public affairs. One must regulate expenditure and care for his fellow man, directing the people in planting crops.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
Here 道 can be substituted for 導, meaning to direct/guide.

乘, sheng4, is described by zdic.net as a "numerary adjunct for vehicles". Note that a kingdom of 1000 chariots was not particularly large by Confucius's time.

使民以時, direct the people in using seasonality. 以 is used as a verb. An important part of leadership in ancient China was the prediction of seasonal patterns through astronomy, astrology, divination, etc.
</details>

### `弟子入則孝出則弟謹而信汎愛眾而親仁`
In his parents' home a disciple should be filial, and on the outside respectful of his elders. He should be modest and trustworthy. He should have love for the masses, and keep close to benevolence.

### `行有馀力則以學文`
And if opportunities come his way he should use them to culture himself.

### `子夏曰賢賢易色事父母能竭其力`
Zixia said: If a disciple reveres virtue instead of sensual desires, in attending to his parents he can expend his full effort.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
賢, xian2, virtuous, worthy, good; able; surpass
Judging from online breakdowns, the first 賢是動詞，第二是名詞。The first is a verb, second is a noun... So "virtue-ing virtue", or "surpassing virtue"? To me it almost makes more sense reversed, as "virtue surpasses". I may need to spend more time on this, but I think the meaning is closer to "virtue surpasses".
<br />
Actually, I think I have a better idea. 賢賢易色 goes VNVN. "Verbing virtue, changing/(making light of) desire". What is the verb form of virtuous? 尊重, to esteem, or 尊崇, to revere.
</details>

### `事君能致其身與朋友交言而有信`
In attending to his lord he can deliver his whole life, and with friends he can speak truth and have trust.

### `雖曰未學吾必谓之學矣`
Although people say he has not learned, I certainly say he has learned.

### `子曰君子不重則不威學則不固`

</details>

### `主忠信無友不如己者過則勿憚改`

### `子禽問於子貢曰夫子至於是邦也必聞其政求之與抑與之與`
Ziqin asked Zigong: When the master arrives at a country he must learn of its politics. Does he search for this information? Or is it given to him by others?

其諸, qi2zhu1, adds speculative tone
異, yi1, strange, different
</details>

### `子曰父在觀其志父沒觀其行三年無改於父之道可谓孝矣`
Confucius said: When a man's father is here, you should observe his ambitions. When his father is gone, you should examine his conduct. If after many years he has not changed from his father's way, he can be called filial.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
It says "three years", but seems to be meant more generally.
This line required some help because I thought the son was the subject, but actually the listener is the subject. 3rd person vs 2nd person, I suppose.
</details>

### `有子曰禮之用和為貴`
Youzi said: In the practice of propriety, harmony becomes valuable.

### `有所不行知和而和不以禮節之亦不可行也`
There are those who do not practice it this way. One can know the value of harmony, then practice it without using rites to control it; this also cannot be made to work.

節: likened to 節制 (to control), 約束 (to restrict)

</details>

Confucius said: The *junzi* eats without seeking fullness, takes residence without seeking ease, he is earnest in his dealings and careful in his speech.

### `就有道而正焉可謂好學也已`

### `子貢曰貧而無諂富而無驕何如`
Zigong said: And what of the poor who are without flattery, or the rich who are without haughtiness?

### `子曰可也未若貧而樂富而好禮者也`

### `子貢曰詩云如切如磋如琢如磨`
Zigong said: The Book of Poetry says "As knife and file make smooth the bone, so jade is wrought by chisel and stone"
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
The actual quote is 如切如磋如琢如磨, which I translated as "like cutting like polishing like polishing jade like grinding." The translation I used was from sacred-texts.com.
It seems to mean that pinnacles of achievement, such as jade or ivory carvings, are crafted carefully over a long period of time, much like a scholar's wisdom.

### `其斯之謂與`
Is this not what was said?

### `子曰賜也始可與言詩已矣告諸往而知來者`
