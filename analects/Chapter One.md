# 《論語》學而 - Xue Er
### `子曰學而時習之不亦說乎`
Confucius said: One who studies and seasonally keeps in practice, is he not joyous?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
子 refers to 孔子, or Confucius.

時 means "time", but really has more to do with seasons and natural cycles.

說 is read as yue4, same as 悅, and 乎 connotes a rhetorical question.
</details>

### `有朋自遠方來不亦樂乎`
For learned friends to come from afar, is this not joyous?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
There are some strange associations between 朋 and 友 and other words.

In ancient times
朋 meant 門, or door/gate/opening.
友 meant 志, or purpose/will.
門 was associated with 一師門 and 學.

Another source associates it with disciples, 弟子.

So I add "learned" to "friends".
</details>

### `人不知而不慍不亦君子乎`
One who is ignored by other people, yet is not angered, is he not a *junzi*?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
慍 is a verb meaning anger. Pronounced yun4.
</details>

### `有子曰其為人也孝弟而好犯上者鮮矣`
Youzi said: Those who are filial and loving, but violate their superiors, are few indeed.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
有子，名若。我姓銳，所以我大概是銳子。

者 takes the verb/action clause that comes before it and turns it into a noun.

為人 means behavior towards others or personal character.
</details>

### `不好犯上而好作乱者未之有也`
Those who respect their superiors, but like to sow chaos, are nonexistent.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
未之有也 means 未有之, but since 未 is negative, the object 之 is put before the verb 有. 也 gives a tone of resolution.
</details>

### `君子务本本立而道生`
The *junzi* attends to the root. Once the root is established, the way is born.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
Here 道, dao4, is the same 道 from the DaoDeJing. Not to necessarily promote an equation of these two ideas, but there is definitely some similarity.
</details>

### `孝弟也者其為仁之本與`
Filial piety: it is probably the root of benevolence.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
The modal expression 也者 Focuses attention on the subject of the sentence while anticipating an explanation. Much like "as for" or "regarding".

與 is a questioning particle, like 吧. It is related to the modal particle 欽, which gives a tone of respect. The structure 其....與 was often used to give an affirmative statement a softer speculative tone.
</details>

### `子曰巧言令色鮮矣仁`
Confucius said: In a man with clever speech and a pleasing face, benevolence will be rare indeed!
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
鮮矣仁 has been transposed from 仁鮮矣 to accentuate the statement.
</details>

### `曾子曰吾日三省吾身`
Zengzi said: I reflect three times daily.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
三, meaning three, is used to mean three times 三次
</details>

### `為人謀而不忠乎與朋友交而不信乎傳不習乎`[^4]
Have I been halfhearted in my dealings? Have I been untrustworthy to my friends? Have I neglected your teaching?
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
謀而不忠 is "to plan for or to counsel and not be completely committed to".

傳 means "to teach" or "what was taught" [by Confucius]. Interpreting it as the latter.
</details>

### `子曰道千乘之国敬事而信節用而愛人使民以时`
To guide a kingdom of 1,000 chariots, one must be conscientious of public affairs. One must regulate expenditure and care for his fellow man, directing the people in planting crops.
<details><summary>Notes</summary>
Here 道 can be substituted for 導, meaning to direct/guide.

乘, sheng4, is described by zdic.net as a "numerary adjunct for vehicles". Note that a kingdom of 1000 chariots was not particularly large by Confucius's time.

使民以時, direct the people in using seasonality. 以 is used as a verb. An important part of leadership in ancient China was the prediction of seasonal patterns through astronomy, astrology, divination, etc.
</details>

### `弟子入则孝出则弟谨而信汎爱众而亲仁`
In the home a young man should be filial, and on the outside respectful of his elders. He should be modest and trustworthy. He should be buoyant with love for the thronging masses, and hold benevolence close to his heart.
